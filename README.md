# Django + React Template

This boilerplate/starter template will help you or you team to jump-start any new `Django + React` project.

This template was designed for use on hosting (not VPS) on which it is impossible to install applications such as Docker, Nginx, Redis, etc.
Of course, you can use this template on VPS and customize it yourself to work with similar applications.
